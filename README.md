![Dance Party](https://s3.amazonaws.com/upperline/curriculum-assets/javascript/dance-party.jpg)

In this project, you're going to be using jQuery and jQuery UI to build a GIF Dance Party! [Check out the original](http://gifdanceparty.giphy.com/) for inspiration!

We've set up some boilerplate code that you can choose to fork and clone if you want - otherwise, feel free to start from scratch!

## Step 1: Basic Setup

Build a basic dance floor and place one gif on the floor (statically). Add in background music.

## Step 2: UI Functionality

Make the one dancer draggable, resizeable, and droppable using [jquery-UI](https://jqueryui.com/). Give it a class and apply the correct methods to it in `script.js`

## Step 3: Multiple Dancers

Add in small thumbnails of a few more dancers. If the thumbnail is clicked, add the GIF to the dance floor. Make sure the GIF is draggable and resizable.

## Step 4: Background

Add a button that uses jQuery to change the background image. Have an array of background links that you can use.

## Step 5: Music

Add a button that uses jQuery to change the music.

## Step 6: Removing Gifs

Build in functionality that lets you get rid of dancers from the dance floor!


## Step 7: KEEP BUILDING!

There is so much more to do - the sky is really the limit with this project. Good Luck!
